How playoff baseball affects heart and sleep patterns in fans.

This project uses python and pandas to analyze csv and json data. The data source is fitbit activity tracker logs and was provided by volunteers who are all self-described Washington Nationals fans. The data covers September-November 2019, tracking fan response to the Nationals' first deep playoff run and eventual World Series title. The visualization is made with Bokeh.

Due to its sensitive nature, the raw data will not be loaded here.
